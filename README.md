# Personal-Mentor-Task-Automation-System
Personal Mentor &amp; Task Automation System
Built a personal task automation and progress tracking system using Python and a Telegram bot, designed to manage goals and daily tasks without relying on chat history.

The system converts manually entered plans into structured goals and tasks, tracks progress through simple chat responses (done / stuck / blocked), and sends scheduled daily reminders and on-demand notifications.

Implemented persistent storage using SQLite, ensuring progress is never lost, and deployed the system on a Linux cloud server as a long-running background service.

This project focuses on backend engineering concepts such as database schema design, state management, scheduling, and automation, rather than chatbot or AI model development.
